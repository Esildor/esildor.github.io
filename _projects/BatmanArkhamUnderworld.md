## Influence & Achievements

Working on Turbines first mobile game was a blast! I learned how to implement a robust and extensible server architecture for mobile games. Writing custom plugins and optimizing for 1gb ram devices really tested my Unity3D skills. I also did a lot of the core work on porting the game to android, which gave me a ton of platform specific experience. There's a lot of interesting challenges with maintaining huge player base.

While on the project:
* Lead a small team of contractors to port the application to Android
* Work on the live ops team to ship multiple app updates with new features
* Spent time debugging/performance optimization with native iOS and Android tool
