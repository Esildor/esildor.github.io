## Influence & Achievements

Being part of Turbine’s 2nd mobile game was revolutionary for my career. Seeing how a company grows from there next game is really special. Watching the tools, tech, and people learn and grow as a team made me a stronger engineer all around! Not to mention, I’m so blessed to working with one of the largest IP’s to date. 

On this project I worked heavily with all parts of the client. From Architecting game systems to UI, it really feels like a game that wouldn’t be the same without my part.

While on the project:
* Helped architect large gameplay systems that are played by millions
* Spent a large portion of the project working on the "Live Events Team".
	* In charge of maintaining player interest by creating rewarding events in game.
	* Developed robust event systems capable of downloading dynamic content and gameplay systems. 
* Preformed critical bug fixes during development and within a Live-Ops situations.
