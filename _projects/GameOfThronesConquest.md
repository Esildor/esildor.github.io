## Influence & Achievements

Being part of Turbine’s 2nd mobile game was revolutionary for my career. Seeing how a company grows and transforms from its first mobile game to the next is really special. Watching the tools, tech, and people learn and grow as a team, made me a stronger engineer all around! Not to mention, is really fun getting to work with one of the most popular IPs in the world. 

On this project, I worked heavily with all parts of the client. I truely felt like I played an essential role in a lean and mean team of engineers. it really feels like a game that wouldn’t be the same without my part.

While on the project:
* Helped architect large gameplay systems that are played by millions
* Worked with designers to extend content, building tools to facilitate the creation of new content
* Handled device-specific features, like notifications, account backup/migration
* Work closely with UI/UX team to take their mockup and build them in the engine.
* Spent a large portion of the project working on the "Live Events Team".
	* In charge of maintaining player interest by creating rewarding events in-game.
	* Developed robust event systems capable of downloading dynamic content and gameplay systems. 
* Performed critical bug fixes during development and within a Live-Ops situation.
