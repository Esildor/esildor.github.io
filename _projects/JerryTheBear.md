## Influence & Achievements

Jerry the Bear is a plush bear with Type 1 Diabetes. The app is designed for kids with T1D (Type 1 Diabetes). Kids learn how to treat Jerry using Augmented Reality games and fun storybooks. On Jerry the Bear, I worked with this small team to push out multiple feature updates, system overhauls and bug fixes.

On this project I worked heavily with all parts of the client. With a team of just 2 engineers, we both had to take a lot of ownership. Basically we both would wear _all the hats_. From Architecting game systems to UI, it really feels like we all had true ownership of this app.

While on the project:
* Streamlined internal systems of the app
* Help refactor systems into there own modular libraries to be used within Sproutel's other applications.
* Develop performance optimizations to target low-end devices.
* Create in-house localize system supporting text and audio.
