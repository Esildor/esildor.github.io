## Influence & Achievements

Sproutel is all about affecting change in children with life altering health problems through fun, educational, and interesting gameplay. I was asked to help out with bug fixing and localization support, which involved creating a localization platform that the company uses today to localize all their applications. I feel really blessed to be able to work on a product that gets to help kids through battling cancer.
