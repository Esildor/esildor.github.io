Software has been my passion since I was a young kid. The idea of commanding a computer to make something beautiful, interesting, or helpful to a user just seemed like magic! Passionate about games my whole life, I knew at a young age I had the drive needed to break into the game industry. After years of work with other extremely talented engineers and designers. Iâ€™m ready to take my skills onto the next fun and thought provoking game or app!
