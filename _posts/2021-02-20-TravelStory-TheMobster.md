This is my first time really writing anything really, and I'm certainly no writer. This is more of a place where I can write down my idea's, thoughts and stories, so I don't forget them when I'm old and gray.

And with that! *drum role please...*

The first blog in a new section I'm going to call **Travel Stories**. Sure a bit simple, but it does what it says on the tin! Really its just tid bits of quirky little moments that happen when you travel.

## When, Where, and Why

* ***When:*** September, 2020
* ***Where:*** [Dubrovnik, Croatia](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dubrovnik,+Croatia/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x134b8ba20835e87d:0x400ad50862bd500?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjqgL-6_oLsAhWd8uAKHWTPA-wQ8gEwKnoECB0QBA)
* ***Why:*** I was traveling during the COVID-19 pandemic _(smart, I know)_. I was still unemployed and just needed to get out of the house. Since America was experiencing pretty high covid cases, we were barred from entry in most counties. Although there was some exceptions to this list of countries who had low covid cases and were a little more risky. **Croatia** is one of those Countries üòà.

## Upon Arrival

First thing I do when I land, is find transportation to the city. Next, find a hostel, or a nice spot in the woods if I'm feeling cheap. Most importantly I build my day pack. Just a small bad with water, battery pack, money, rain gear, maybe a book or journal. 

Finally, I set out the door.  Then I just start walking. I find that I can get the best feel for a city or town by just walking. You can take in all the vibes from the social situations. I found that this will kind of set the mood for your experience in the area.

I can tell you how I feel and what my first impressions are for every city or town I've been in. Its a pretty distinct feeling. But just because this feeling is distinct, doesn't make it true. It doesn't truly set the intention for how your going to like the area.

Croatia was one of the worst initial experience I sensed. The place was dead. Barely any people around at all. And the people I did see, seemed like tourists. Granted, I didn't expect many tourists due to COVID. However, I didn't expect a little. But what made it notably strange is that Dubrovnik had **so much** residential housing. The place is basically on mountain thats falling into the ocean.
